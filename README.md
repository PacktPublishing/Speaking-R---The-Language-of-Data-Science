# Speaking ‘R’ - The Language of Data Science [Video]
This is the code repository for [Speaking ‘R’ - The Language of Data Science](https://prod.packtpub.com/in/application-development/speaking-r-language-data-science-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
n this video course, we start by focusing on R’s similarities with programming languages such as basic/c/c# with loops and conditional tests like if, so that you can feel at home and be productive straight away. 
We begin by introducing R and setting things up so that you are ready to go using Rstudio, the associated IDE. Then we look at R as a programming language and see how the standard things are done in it, so you can see that it’s not that different from other programming languages. Next, we introduce some R commands, which are very useful and not as common in traditional languages since manipulating data is more important in R.
Moving on, we look at an example in the Titanic dataset, which is the kind of thing you’ll come across in R, a multidimensional collection of variables of different types. Using the tools that we cover we can form a picture, a story behind the data. 
We then look at cleaning up data, which is what 80% of data science is - as we rarely get a nice neat set of numbers, but mostly unstructured junk. This is just trial and error, gradually getting to something we can work with.
Finally, we cover statistics, which is where R originated and what it was designed for.We begin doing some basic statistics with R to show how it works and end up using various special features for data visualization.

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:
●	Previous programming experience using variables, loops and conditional tests
●	Experience working with stats since we show how to compute some statistics using R, assuming the user knows what they are

### Technical Requirements
This course has the following software requirements:
•	The software being covered runs on Windows, Mac and Linux
•	A computer with internet connection.
•	The programs are freely available and we show were we can get and how to install them
•	The primary software used only require 32MB RAM according to the Rstudio site and admin privileges though more needed if want to work with larger data sets and install many packages. The R and Rstudio directories for system the lessons developed on took close to 1GB for example.

The course has been tested on the following system configuration:
●	OS: Windows 10
●	Processor: i5 6200 U 2.3Ghz
●	Memory: 8GB
●	Hard Disk Space: 256GB SSD
●	Video Card: Intel HD520
